        h2 History 
        p
          | According to the Fae, the entire world, including Prythian, the Kingdom of Hybern, and the Mortal Lands, was birthed from a magical object of extreme and unimaginable power called The Cauldron. 
          br
          |     Five hundred years prior to the beginning of A Court of Thorns and Roses, the lands of the mortal humans and the immortal Fae had no separation between them. Many Fae from Prythian and the Kingdom of Hybern abused and mistreated humans, often holding them as slaves. This, along with other factors, is what drove the humans to begin the War, a conflict which forced the immortal Fae of Prythian to choose to fight alongside the humans to help them gain their freedom or to join the King of Hybern and his ruthless commander Amarantha to defeat the humans and continue their enslavement. At the end of the War, a Treaty was established between the Fae and the humans abolishing human enslavement by the Fae and ordering the separation of Prythian from the Mortal Lands by the enormous, invisible structure called The Wall. It also stated that the Fae must remain in Prythian. If a Fae were to cross over into the Mortal Lands, the humans have a right to dispose of that Fae however they choose.

          a(href='') Geography
        p
          | Prythian is composed of seven separately ruled lands called &quot;courts&quot; consisting of four seasonal courts: the Summer Court, the Autumn Court, the Winter Court, and the Spring Court, and three solar courts: the Night Court, the Day Court, and the Dawn Court. It also borders the Mortal Lands to the south, with the only separation between them being the Wall, and lies east of the Kingdom of Hybern.
          br
          |     The name Prythian is a corruption of the ancient name for Britain, which is Brython or Britton, perhaps a nod to the silhouette of the land resembling that of Great Britain. Likewise, Hybern is a corruption of Hibernia, the ancient name for Ireland. Geographically, Hybern is an island off the coast of Prythian as Ireland is an island off the coast of Britain, albeit in the other direction.
        h3#seasonal Seasonal Courts
        p
          | Prythian consists of four seasonal courts: Spring, Summer, Autumn, and Winter. The geography of the seasonal courts begins with the Spring Court, the southernmost court, and the only court to border the wall that separates the Mortal Lands from Prythian. North of the Spring Court lies the Summer Court and Autumn Court, Summer to the east, and Autumn to the west. The fourth and final seasonal court is the Winter Court, which lies north of the Summer Court and Autumn Court. 
          br
          |         Despite following the natural cycle of night and day, each of the seasonal courts only remains in the season specified by their court name. The Summer Court only ever experiences summer, the Winter Court only ever experiences winter, the Autumn Court only ever experiences autumn, and the Spring Court only ever experiences spring.

        p
          | North of the seasonal courts resides the three solar courts: the Night Court, the Day Court, and the Dawn Court. The Dawn Court resides north of the Winter Court and is known for its mountain palace in the clouds. Continuing North of the Dawn Court is the Day Court, the court said to contain much of Prythian&apos;s history within its abundance of libraries. Occupying the land to the far north is the Night Court, the largest and most feared of all of the courts. 
          br
          |     Unlike the seasonal courts, the solar courts do not remain in eternal states of dawn, day, or night. Each of them follows the daily cycle of day and night, although it has been stated that those of the Night Court experience more stunning and breathtaking night scenes than that of the other courts.
